## üìù Project Overview

DMQC automates quality assessment in mammography by segmenting anatomical features and imaging artifacts using deep learning, followed by rule-based evaluation aligned with [PGMI criteria](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/pgmi-image-evaluation-system-of-mammography). This system was developed as part of a Bachelor's thesis at the University of Oulu.

## üß† Methods

DMQC applies a two-step approach: deep learning-based segmentation of mammograms, followed by a rule-based evaluation aligned with PGMI criteria.

- **Dataset**: 503 manually annotated mediolateral oblique (MLO) view mammograms from Oulu University Hospital.

- **Annotations**: Images were labeled in CVAT with five pixel-level classes: whole breast, breast, pectoral muscle, nipple, and skin-folds.

- **Architecture**: U-Net and Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) decoders were tested with VGG11, ResNet34, and ResNet50 backbones. The U-Net architecture consists of an encoder-decoder path with skip connections to enable precise localization.

- **Workflow**: The system preprocesses input images, applies deep learning segmentation, and then evaluates the segmented masks based on diagnostic quality rules.

- **Training**:
  - Input size: 512√ó256 (resized and zero-padded to preserve aspect ratio)
  - Augmentations: horizontal flips and cropping
  - Loss: multi-class cross-entropy
  - Evaluation metric: Dice coefficient (per class)

- **Quality Assessment**: After segmentation, a custom rule-based script evaluates four key positioning criteria from the predicted masks, including presence of the nipple, detection of skin-folds, muscle angle, and muscle length.

## üìä Results

- **Segmentation Results**: The best-performing model (FPN with VGG11 backbone) achieved Dice scores above 0.90 for whole breast, breast, and muscle classes, and over 0.63 for skin-folds and nipple.

- **Automated Assessment Output**: The software interprets the segmentation results to generate quality control reports, flagging issues such as poor nipple positioning or inadequate muscle visualization.
